Kicad files for David S Weiss's Quantum Computing Experiment

Kicad files generally include a project file, schematic, and PCB file. Finished projects that have been sent to fabrication will also contain a set of gerber files defining the layers for fabrication. Projects exist in various states of completion and functionality so double check your work.
